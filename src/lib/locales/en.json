Hold down **SET**, select your 'wildcard' user (e.g., slot 4) and modify the data.\n3. At the end it will ask 'CLr?' (Clear?). Say **YES** (Don't worry, since the SD card is not inserted, nothing important gets deleted).\n4. **INSERT THE SD CARD**, press the wildcard user button and take the measurement.\n(The scale will save the new data to the file without deleting the history).",
