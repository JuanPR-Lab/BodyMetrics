    "guide_2_title": "🚀 2. Daily Flow",
    "guide_2_text": "Every time you enter or refresh the app: 1. **Drag or load the SD files** into the Inbox. 2. **Assign** each measurement to the corresponding client. (If this is your first time using the app, you can create your first client below to get started).",
    "guide_3_title": "∞ 3. Trick: Infinite Users",
    "guide_3_text": "The scale has only 4 slots, but you can measure unlimited people without deleting data using this trick: \n1. **REMOVE SD CARD** (Very important). \n2. Press and hold **SET**, select your 'wildcard' user (e.g. #4), and update Age/Height. \n3. At the end, it asks 'CLr?'. Select **YES** (Don't worry, since the SD card is out, nothing important is deleted). \n4. **INSERT SD CARD** and weigh. \n(The scale will append the new data to the file without erasing previous history).",
